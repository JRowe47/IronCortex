1. Review [Numenta HTM integration ideas](docs/numenta_htm_integration.md) and prototype key components.
2. Replace grid neighbors/coords with true hex axial layouts.
3. Explore alternative token heads or mixture-of-experts approaches.
4. Strengthen verifier targets with domain-specific constraints.
5. Investigate strict forward-forward training by detaching cross-time paths.
6. Expand tests to cover training stability, generation quality, and wiring utilities.
7. Begin exploring text generation using a diffusion paradigm and other non-standard model features.
